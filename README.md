## Deep Learning-Based Vegetable Image Classification System

GreenClassify is an end-to-end deep learning web application that classifies vegetable images into **15 predefined categories** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

The trained model is deployed using **Flask**, allowing users to upload images and receive **real-time predictions with confidence scores** through a clean and interactive web interface.

The system achieves **92.9% test accuracy**.
